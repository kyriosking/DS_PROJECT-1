# Analyzing Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib


## Project Motivation
Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style and various other information. This year, they amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries. I have several questions to explore insights of this dataset

- Which country has the largest survey respondent?
- Which professional has the largest number of respond of this survey?
- What is the average years of experience of all developer?
- Is there any relation between Education and Salary?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings to give the reader insight into the questions posed.
